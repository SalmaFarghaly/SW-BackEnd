we will use request package in node.js to send requests to server so take a look for requests created in test-searchController.js file in test folder 


please follow the naming convention test-<controllername>.js  for example : test-userController.js

## to run the tests
    *npm install request
    *npm run watch
    *open new power shell by clicking "+" symbol in terminal
    *type in the new power shell  npm run test
